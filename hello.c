// There are 3 steps in executing a code in c:
// 1. code hello.c (creates a file called hello.c)
// 2. make hello (identify the file and initiates the compiling of the code)
// 3 ./hello (run the program called hello)
//note that hello is the file that the compiler has created after compiling the source code with the ./hello command
